DPWII brought to you by Drew Wallace

I spent many hours working tirelessly on this webpage.
I knew from the beginning that I was going to make a "portfolio" webpage, something to display all of my works, 
in and outside of class.

My first and foremost priority in making my website was to emphasize aethetic and design. 
I am well aware that gradients are really in right now especially the corner-to-corner type,
I originally intended to have a big banner saying "Hello, World!" as an homage to the first words on the internet
as this website is the first of my words put on a website I created myself.

Ultimately "Hello, World!" didnt make it into the final cut, But gradients galore did. I wanted from the start to have
an external style sheet that way I could format the rest of the pages share the same style.
I started my webpage obviously on the homepage, I decided to use another homage as my main banner, 
and made a small "snippet" of my work on the front page to entice veiwers to search deeper within the website.

when I made the flex-box for the images on the front page I had a significantly difficult time with it's construction
having a real hard time getting the images to set nicely next to eachother and to fit well, as well as to make
the flex-box responsive for mobile. This is a problem that persisted throughout my composition of my website 
as my Logo, Menu, Paragraphs relied on Flex boxes so I struggled for what felt like an eternity, It took atleast 6 hours per each element
and after watching several videos and and reading from W3 about flex-box's, item's, and container's which would
be the basis of all the galleries I would use on my webpage, with some help from
bootstrap gallery elements with some tweaking of my own, but I had made the gallery on the homepage without intervention or inspiration
 Finally I had the flexbox where I wanted it after understanding that
you move the items accordingly in a flex box not the container, which seems obvious now.

after finishing the flex-box I browsed the reddit page r/web_page and found a fancy animation someone made with text
that hade letters fall into the screen, I wanted a feature like this on my web page but
 I do not have the knowledge to do that so I decided upon adding a Fade in effect 
to the nav, h1 (for the logo), and the menu. This spiced up my webpage significantly I thought.

One featureI also spent alot of time making sure the nav was specifically on the left side eventhough the nav button I based mine off
of (A sandwich menu tutorial that we had watched in class) was located on the right. I had also decided to center my 
menu. 

The entire time I was working on my webpage I had responsiveness in mind, swapping probably atleast 500 times a night 
between full page and mobile making sure everything lined up and looked nice as I had alot of work to display and 
wanted everything displayed in a specific way. 

I have two Types of work that I wanted to display, my artistic work and my Design work. For design I wanted to display
alot of the design work I had done for school like my Computing principles script "Cursor Cruiser" displayed under a 
gallery of my previous work, all form fitting to the aesthetic I had in mind. For the art page I wanted to display my 
drawings and more non-school related works I wanted to show, Like my animations. On my Art page I wanted to display front
and center my most recent animation, and after several more hours messing with "grids" to center "iframe" elements like 
the "cursor cruiser" script and the halloween animation I made for Studio 1. I learned extensive information about how 
grids work to fit things more tidely than what I had previously been doing. 

Finally, I Added an about page to give those visiting the page an opputunity to hear my background, and where
they could find the rest of my works in other subjects than art and design on different websites via a table 
with all the websites im am on, with a link to each of my profile pages on everysite including GitHub. and a contact page 
with a "Get" form to give an opputunity for those visiting to contact me.
